The source directory; this is automatically two folder up because the script
 is located in ROM vendor in scripts. The logic is as follows:

 1. Get the absolute path of the script with os.path.realpath in case there is a symlink
    This script may be symlinked by a manifest so we need to account for that.

 2. Get the folder containing the script with directory name.

 3. Move into the folder that is three folders above that one and print it.
